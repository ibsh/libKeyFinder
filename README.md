# `libKeyFinder`

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/ibsh/libKeyFinder.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/ibsh/libKeyFinder)

`libKeyFinder` can be used to estimate the musical key of digital recordings.

It is the basis of the KeyFinder GUI app, which is available as a binary download for Mac OSX and Windows at www.ibrahimshaath.co.uk/keyfinder

## Examples

For the most basic use case, do something like this:

```C++
// Static because it retains useful resources for repeat use
static KeyFinder::KeyFinder k;

// Build an empty audio object
KeyFinder::AudioData a;

// Prepare the object for your audio stream
a.setFrameRate(yourAudioStream.framerate);
a.setChannels(yourAudioStream.channels);
a.addToSampleCount(yourAudioStream.length);

// Copy your audio into the object
for (int i = 0; i < yourAudioStream.length; i++) {
  a.setSample(i, yourAudioStream[i]);
}

// Run the analysis
KeyFinder::KeyDetectionResult r =  k.keyOfAudio(a);

// And do something with the result
doSomethingWith(r.globalKeyEstimate);
```

Alternatively, you can transform a stream of audio into a chromatic representation, and make progressive estimates of the key:

```C++
KeyFinder::AudioData a;
a.setFrameRate(yourAudioStream.framerate);
a.setChannels(yourAudioStream.channels);
a.addToSampleCount(yourAudioStream.packetLength);

static KeyFinder::KeyFinder k;

// the workspace holds the memory allocations for analysis of a single track
KeyFinder::Workspace w;

while (someType yourPacket = newAudioPacket()) {

  for (int i = 0; i < yourPacket.length; i++) {
    a.setSample(i, yourPacket[i]);
  }
  k.progressiveChromagram(a, w);

  // if you want to grab progressive key estimates...
  KeyFinder::KeyDetectionResult r = k.keyOfChromagram(w);
  doSomethingWithMostRecentKeyEstimate(r.globalKeyEstimate);
}

// to squeeze every last bit of audio from the working buffer...
k.finalChromagram(w);

// and finally...
KeyFinder::KeyDetectionResult r = k.keyOfChromagram(w);

doSomethingWithFinalKeyEstimate(r.globalKeyEstimate);
```

## Installation

First, you will need to install `libKeyFinder`'s dependencies:

* [FFTW version 3](http://www.fftw.org/download.html)

  OSX and homebrew: `$ brew install fftw`

* [Qt 5](http://www.qt.io/download-open-source/)

  `libKeyFinder` uses [`qmake`](http://doc.qt.io/qt-5/qmake-manual.html), which is distributed with Qt, to generate `Makefile`s.

  OSX and homebrew: `$ brew install qt5`

  *Note that the qt5 homebrew formula is [keg-only](https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew/blob/master/share/doc/homebrew/FAQ.md#what-does-keg-only-mean), meaning that it is not linked into `/usr/local` automatically because it conflicts with earlier versions of qt which may already be installed. To link it forcefully so that it (along with qmake and others) can be used easily, run `brew link qt5 --force`.*

Once dependencies are installed, build `libKeyFinder`:

```sh
$ qmake
$ make
$ make install
```

## Testing

After having successfully installed the library following the above instructions, run the following commands to build and run the tests:

```sh
$ cd tests/
$ qmake
$ make
$ ./tests
```

If all goes well, you should see something like this:

```
===============================================================================
All tests passed (1705510 assertions in 65 test cases)
```

Note that there is a known intermittent failure in the `FftAdapterTest/ForwardAndBackward` test. Try running the tests a handful of times to determine whether you are hitting the intermittent or have introduced a new bug.
